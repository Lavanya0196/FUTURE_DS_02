# FUTURE_DS_02
I have created a dashboard for Facebook Ads campaign using powerBI. The dashboard provides a comprehensive performance overview of the Facebook campaign by combining demographic, interest-based, and engagement metrics. It tracks campaign activity across specific reporting periods using identifiers such as ad_id, campaign_id, and fb_campaign_id.

It segments audience performance by age, gender, and up to three interest categories (interest1, interest2, interest3), enabling targeted analysis.

Key performance indicators (KPIs) included are:

Impressions – total number of times the ads were displayed

Clicks – number of user interactions with the ads

Spent – total advertising cost

Total Conversion – total number of desired actions taken

Approved Conversion – validated or qualified conversions
